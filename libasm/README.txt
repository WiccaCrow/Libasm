Hello!
Here two tests.

1st test with ready data to test your functions.

2nd test is made for your enjoyment and fun. You can enter any
	data for verification in the file test.txt (directory
	test_1) following the instructions (see below).
______________________________________________________________

To check your functions:
1. put your functions (format *.s) to directory 'libasm_main'.
2. 	run Makefile to test1:
		make test1
	run Makefile to test2:
		make test1
______________________________________________________________

Instruction for test2:

	The first word in the line is the name of the function ft_ 
(for example, ft_strlen).

	Further, a space is required.

	Further data for functions.
